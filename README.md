        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Helena (Helli) Robertson. I am currently undertaking Cardiff University's MSc in Computational
            and Data Journalism, with the hope of pursuing a career in data journalism when I graduate this year.
        </p>

        <p>I graduated last year from UCL with a BA in Geography with Quantitative Methods, where I studied human
            geography alongside modules in data analysis and visualisation, and social science research methods.</p>

        <p>In the summer before my final year at UCL, I spent eight weeks as an intern at the Financial Times,
            producing daily graphics, as well as researching and creating chart-led pieces.</p>
        <p>In November 2018, I worked overnight at Sky News assisting with the US Midterms programme. Along with
            three fellow students, I was sourcing results as they were called by US broadcasters to feed into
            projection models for the House and Senate, and to report live on the Sky TV programme.</p>
        <p>In my final undergraduate year, I was part of the Design Team for Pi Media, a multimedia platform at UCL.
            I assisted with the website and logo redesign, and worked with the magazine editors to produce
            commissioned graphics for the quarterly print version, as well as for the promotion of articles and
            events across social media.</p>
